# BaseConverter
Broaden the to_binary() function to a to_base_n() function that takes a second int (base) in the range 2â€“16. If the base is outside this range, the program prints an error. The function should output the number in the given base, octal numbers printed with 0 and hexadecimal numbers printed with 0x beforehand.
